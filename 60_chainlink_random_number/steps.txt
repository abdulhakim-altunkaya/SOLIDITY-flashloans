0) Open this webpage and take a look:
https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/subscription/examples/get-a-random-number/#create-and-deploy-a-vrf-v2-compatible-contract


1) Add "Fantom testnet" to your metamask.

2) Go to Fantom testnet faucet and get some FTM tokens
https://faucet.fantom.network/

3) Go to this website and find "Fantom testnet" settings
https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks/#fantom-testnet

First add "LINK" token to your Metamask, you will see a button for this.

Then go to LINK faucet for Fantom testnet and get some LINK tokens
https://faucets.chain.link/fantom-testnet

4)Open subscription manager: https://vrf.chain.link/fantom-testnet
You can find this link also on the webpage in step 0.

5) Click on "create subscription"

6) Enter your Metamask account which has FTM and LINK tokens

7) Then Add funds. Sending 10 LINK tokens is more than enough.

8) You will need a chainlink contract to get random numbers. This contract is called
"VRFv2Consumer.sol". You can find contract on the webpage in step 0. On that webpage,
you will see a button "Open in Remix" button, click on it. 

9) You can deploy this contract without anychange if you are using Goerli Testnet.
However we are using Fantom Testnet. So, CHANGE

10) Make sure, you are using "injected provider" on Remix
and make sure your Metamask account and Fantom testnet is connected to Remix.

11) Go to your subscription page, you will find an "id" number. Copy it and go back to Remix.
Compile the contract and then in the deployment, paste "id" number as constructor argument and click "deploy" button.

12) Then copy contract address and go to subscription page. There add contract address by clicking "Add Consumer" button. 

13) Open contract interaction interface area:
-click on "requestRandomWords" button. This will produce a "requestId"
-Then click on "lastRequestId" button. This will show "requestId". Copy it. 
-Then go to "getRequestStatus" button. Paster the request and click on the button.
It will show you a bool value and uint[] value. uint[] contains our random numbers.
"randomWords" should not confuse you. They are random numbers.

14) You will see we have 2 random numbers. That's because we asked chainlink to produce 2 random numbers.
On contract, try to find "uint32 numWords = 2;" If you change it to 1, then you will get 1 random number.
