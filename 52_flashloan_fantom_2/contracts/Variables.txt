Storage


calldata
It is data location for function parameters only
Which means you can see a calldata variable only in function parameters.
calldata variables are immutable/non-modifiable 
calldata variables are non-persistant, they are deleted when function execution finishes.
The space for calldata variable values is allocated for the external function caller.


Memory
It is data location for function parameters and also function implementation
Which means, you can see a memory variable inside function parameters and also inside function implementation.

Memory variables are also non-persistant. They are deleted when function execution finishes.
The space for memory variable values is allocated for the contract.

Reference type/value type

Data location (memory, storage, and calldata) needs to be specified for reference type variables.
Since uint is a value type, it is not specified.
Stack is also data location for storing small local variables.
